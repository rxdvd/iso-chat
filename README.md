# iso-chat
Simple chat written in node.js using express and socket.io with user customisation. Chat messages are encrypted using a homemade JavaScript implementation of the Camellia cipher and stored in an easily parsable form within chatlog.txt. Made to practice the concept of creating a more responsive chat interface using the event-driven nature of node.js. A more complete solution would have used a database to store the messages but I decided to keep it simple to focus more on the mechanics of the chat itself.
